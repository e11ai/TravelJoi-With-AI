Avoid taxis and ride-sharing services, as they can be expensive.\n*   **Food:** Look for inexpensive dining options, such as food courts, fast-food restaurants, and grocery store delis. Bring your own water bottle to avoid buying drinks.\n*   **Gambling:** Set a strict budget for gambling (if you choose to do so) and don't exceed it. The focus should be on free entertainment.\n*   **Free Entertainment:** Vegas is full of free shows and activities. Take advantage of them!\n\n**How to Use This JSON:**\n* Copy the entire JSON structure above.\n* You can use a JSON viewer or your programming skills to parse it.\n* Use it to build an interactive travel app, or to generate a basic schedule.\n\nEnjoy your budget-friendly trip to Las Vegas!
